### `Installation`

To view the site, I recommend going to the live [over/under](https://over-under-app.herokuapp.com/) site hosted on heroku.<br><br>
If you'd like you can also fork and load the site in developement, in conjunction with the rails backend [here](https://github.com/elandau91/mod4-game-backend). When loading the site through the repos, make sure to run the rails server on the backend before doing the npm start or yarn start in this repo.
